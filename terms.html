<p>In consideration of Atomic Commit, Inc., a Rhode Island corporation ("Atomic Commit, Inc."), furnishing services to enable me to use the RandomRun application in connection with activities including, but not limited to cycling, running, route planning, and/or participation in Virtual Events (hereinafter collectively referred to as "Activities"), I agree to the terms of this Atomic Commit, Inc. Waiver and Release of Liability ("Release") as set forth herein.</p>

<strong>I fully understand and acknowledge the following:</strong>

<p>The Activities have inherent risks, dangers, and hazards;</p>
